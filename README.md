# bachelor-project

Repository for hosting deliverables for my Bachelor's project in the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, fall 2014.

The project was to create a web app for a local newspaper, Adresseavisen AS, that helped them dynamically create ads for print in their newspaper, and we focused our project around the creation of obituaries. Technologies used include Bootstrap, JQuery, AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
